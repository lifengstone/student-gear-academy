Guidelines for assignments:

- Create a dedicated GitHub repository for the homework.
- Your repository name should include the -gear-academy suffix, for example, myname-gear-academy.
- Exclude build artifacts such as target, .binpath, and editor files from the repository.
- Enable GitHub actions for your repository.
- Submit a homework as a pull request (PR) from a feature branch derived from the main branch.
- Don't include any unrelated changes in the PR.
- If any changes are requested, make updates within the existing branch and PR.
- PR should be merged to the main branch after the homework is accepted.
- Do not include any scaffolding code, private keys, or passwords in the PR.
- Ensure the tests and build process pass successfully.
- You may use git from the command line instead of relying on the GitHub web interface.
